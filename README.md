# Item-Catalog

This repository consists of my work for Project 3 of [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Set up
Follow the instructions [here](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud088/vagrant) to install a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) virtual machine that contains all the packages required to run this project. After completing the install, run the virtual machine and proceed to the instructions section.

## Instructions
1. Clone the project repository to you current working directory
```
git clone https://github.com/ilhaan/Tournament-Results.git
```
1. Change your working directory to the cloned repository
```
cd Item-Catalog
```
1. Run the web server
```
python server.py
```
1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`

You will now be able to navigate through the `Item-Catalog` project. In order to view the JSON API endpoint, navigate to `http://localhost:5000/catalog.json`.

Once you are done, terminate the web server using `CTRL+C` in the terminal running `server.py`.
